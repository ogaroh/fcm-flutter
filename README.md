A Flutter application implementing push notifications using Firebase Cloud Messaging

# TODO:
Download XCode
Setup APNs on iOS
Setup the iOS version (io.github.ogaroh.pushnotifications.ios) with the FCM and Firebase Core SDK (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq9-DPKWtIc, https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging, https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/overviewhttps://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/messaging/usage, https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview/)
Test configuration and make sure notifications fire as expected
Configure FCM project for REST calls
Create a custom REST API that triggers the FCM messages; use Python or NodeJS - the latter preferred for compatibility with other projects and ease of use with the Firebase SDK
Test in Dev
Configure server on Azure
Deploy and test
